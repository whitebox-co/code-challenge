# code-challenge

### Welcome to the Whitebox Code Challenge!

In this repo, you are given an HTML template for an e-commerce store. The store has only two pages: A main products list page (`product.html`), and a single product detail page (`product-detail.html`). Both pages contain all the HTML and CSS needed for this project and you can focus solely on the Javascript side of this challenge.

Your goal, is to...

1. Build a NodeJS server to serve some JSON data.
2. Wire up both HTML pages to your new server.

You may obtain the JSON data by using this url directly in your NodeJS Server code:
https://next.json-generator.com/api/json/get/EkzBIUWNL

### More specifically we are looking for you to meet the following requirements:

1. Create a NodeJS Server that has 2 endpoints. GetMany should return the entire list of fake products. GetSingle should accept an ID, and return just that 1 product.

2. Create an SPA which wires up the static HTML to your new server using the sample JSON (You can use (or not) any framework you are comfortable with).

3. "Wire up" includes any search, sort, or filters you see on the page.

4. The SPA should have 2 pages, a list all products, and an individual product page. Both HTML templates are provided.

5. Delivery should be a separate github repo on your own account.

### Tips
- You should not need to modify the CSS.
- For experienced developers we have seen this challenge take about 2 hours. For new developers we have seen this challenge take up to four hours.
- Let me know if you have any questions or things you want clarified.
- We are looking for your ability to use Javascript, your code style and structure, and your ability to follow the technical requirements listed in this readme.
