https://next.json-generator.com/api/json/get/EkzBIUWNL

1) Create a NodeJS server that has getMany & getSingle API endpoints using
this JSON URL
2) Create a SPA which wires up the static HTML given in the repo (You can
use (or not) any framework you're comfortable with).  
2.5) Wire up includles any search, sort or filters you see
3) The SPA should have 2 pages, a list all products, and an individual
product page. Both HTML templates are provided.
4) Delivery should be a separate github repo on your own account.

We're only going to read through Javascript on both the client and the
server, so focus your energy there. You should not need to create any new
UI elements.
